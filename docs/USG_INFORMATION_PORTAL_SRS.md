## 14. Implementation Notes

### 14.1 Scope Management
During implementation, an **EventRegistration** feature was identified as scope creep (not in original SRS) and was successfully removed on November 4, 2025, bringing the module to 100% SRS compliance.

### 14.2 Architecture Decisions
- **Service Layer:** All business logic encapsulated in dedicated service classes
- **Admin Namespace:** Admin controllers organized in separate namespace
- **Route Organization:** Public and admin routes clearly separated
- **Modular Structure:** Following nwidart/laravel-modules architecture

### 14.3 Database Design
- **Proper Indexing:** All foreign keys and frequently queried columns indexed
- **Flexible Enums:** Status enums support complete workflows
- **JSON Fields:** Used for flexible data structures (goals, objectives, tags, etc.)
- **Soft Deletes:** Not implemented (hard deletes with cascade/set null)

### 14.4 Frontend Architecture
- **Component Reusability:** Shared components across pages
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript for all React components
- **State Management:** Inertia.js for seamless server-client communication
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS 4
