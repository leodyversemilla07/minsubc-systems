## 🛠️ FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT GUIDE

### **1. Install shadcn/ui Components**

```bash
# Core components
npx shadcn@latest add button card badge input textarea select

# Data display
npx shadcn@latest add table data-table avatar

# Forms
npx shadcn@latest add form label checkbox radio-group

# Feedback
npx shadcn@latest add dialog alert toast

# Date/Time
npx shadcn@latest add calendar date-picker

# File upload
npx shadcn@latest add file-upload
```

### **2. Page Structure Template**

```tsx
// resources/js/Pages/sas/admin/scholarships/index.tsx
import { Head, Link } from '@inertiajs/react'
import AdminLayout from '@/layouts/admin-layout'
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { Card } from '@/components/ui/card'

interface Props {
    scholarships: {
        data: Scholarship[]
        links: any
        meta: any
    }
}

export default function Index({ scholarships }: Props) {
    return (
        <AdminLayout>
            <Head title="Scholarships - SAS Admin" />
            
            <div className="space-y-6">
                {/* Header */}
                <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
                    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Scholarships</h1>
                    <Link href={route('sas.admin.scholarships.create')}>
                        <Button>Add Scholarship</Button>
                    </Link>
                </div>

                {/* Content */}
                <Card>
                    {/* Your data table here */}
                </Card>
            </div>
        </AdminLayout>
    )
}
```

### **3. Use Inertia Features**

```tsx
// Forms with Inertia v2
import { useForm } from '@inertiajs/react'

const { data, setData, post, processing, errors } = useForm({
    scholarship_name: '',
    scholarship_type: '',
    // ...
})

const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    post(route('sas.admin.scholarships.store'))
}
```

### **4. Styling with Tailwind v4**

```tsx
// Use modern Tailwind v4 syntax
<div className="flex gap-4 p-6">
    <Card className="bg-white/80 dark:bg-gray-900/80">
        {/* Content */}
    </Card>
</div>
```

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before starting frontend, verify backend:

```bash
# 1. Check all routes are registered
php artisan route:list --path=sas
# Should show 69 routes

# 2. Verify data exists
php artisan tinker --execute="
    echo App\Modules\SAS\Models\Scholarship::count() . ' scholarships\n';
    echo App\Modules\SAS\Models\Organization::count() . ' organizations\n';
"

# 3. Run backend verification script
php verify-sas-backend.php

# 4. Check services are working
php artisan tinker --execute="
    \$service = new App\Modules\SAS\Services\ScholarshipService();
    echo 'ScholarshipService loaded: ' . get_class(\$service);
"

# 5. Test a route (requires authentication)
# Visit: http://localhost/sas/organizations
```

---

## 📝 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### **For Each Page:**

1. **Create the page file**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p resources/js/Pages/sas/admin/scholarships
   code resources/js/Pages/sas/admin/scholarships/index.tsx
   ```

2. **Build the UI**
   - Import layout and components
   - Use TypeScript for props
   - Use Inertia helpers (Link, useForm)
   - Apply Tailwind styling

3. **Test it**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit the route in browser
   ```

4. **Iterate**
   - Add more features
   - Improve UX
   - Handle loading states
   - Add error handling
