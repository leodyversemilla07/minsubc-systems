Thank you for your interest in contributing to the MinSU Systems Platform! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors to our multi-system platform.

## About This Project

The MinSU Systems Platform is a comprehensive web-based platform built with Laravel 13, Inertia.js v2, React 19, TypeScript, and Shadcn UI. It consists of four integrated systems serving different aspects of Mindoro State University operations:

- **📄 Document Request System (Registrar)**: Automates document request processing for the Registrar's Office
- **📊 Student Affairs and Services (SAS)**: Student affairs and services management
- **🏛️ University Student Government (USG)**: Student government operations and management
- **🗳️ Voting System**: Student elections and voting management

2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leodyversemilla07/minsubc-systems.git
   cd minsubc-systems
   ```

3. **Set up the development environment**:
   ```bash
   # Install PHP dependencies
   composer install

   # Install Node.js dependencies
   npm install

   # Copy environment file
   cp .env.example .env

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   # Start Laravel server
   php artisan serve

   # Start Vite dev server (in another terminal)
   npm run dev
   ```

### 📝 Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # Or for specific systems:
   git checkout -b feature/registrar/document-validation
   git checkout -b feature/sas/event-management
   git checkout -b feature/usg/election-system
   git checkout -b feature/voting/ballot-improvements
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   # Run PHP tests
   php artisan test

   # Run frontend linting
   npm run lint

   # Format code
   npm run format
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(registrar): add document request validation"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork** and **create a pull request**

### 🏗️ System Architecture

This platform uses a modular architecture:

```
Modules/
├── Registrar/      # Document request system
├── SAS/            # Student affairs and services
├── USG/            # Student government operations
└── VotingSystem/   # Student elections and voting

resources/js/pages/
├── registrar/      # Frontend pages for document system
├── sas/            # Frontend pages for student affairs
├── usg/            # Frontend pages for student government
└── voting/         # Frontend pages for voting system
```

### 🛠️ Development Standards

#### PHP/Laravel Standards
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use Laravel Pint for code formatting: `vendor/bin/pint`
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Add PHPDoc blocks for classes and methods
- Use explicit return types and type hints
- Follow module-based architecture for new features

#### React/TypeScript Standards
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Follow the existing component structure
- Use Shadcn UI components when possible
- Run ESLint: `npm run lint`
- Format code with Prettier: `npm run format`
- Organize components by system/module

#### Module Development
- Each system should be self-contained within its module
- Shared logic goes in `app/Services/` or `app/Http/Controllers/`
- Follow consistent naming conventions across modules
- Document inter-module dependencies

#### Testing
- Write Pest tests for new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Run tests before committing: `php artisan test`
- Test both individual modules and integration points

### 📋 Pull Request Guidelines

2. **Update documentation** if your changes affect user-facing features
3. **Add tests** for new functionality
4. **Ensure all tests pass**
5. **Update the changelog** if applicable
6. **Follow commit message conventions**
